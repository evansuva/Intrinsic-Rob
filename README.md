# An Empirical Evaluation of Intrinsic Robustness on Real Distributions

The goals of this project are to:

1. Theoretically, derive a intrinsic robustness bound for a large collection of imperfect classifiers using Lipschitz parameter.

2. Empirically, evaluate the intrinsic robustness bound for benchmark image distributions.

Additionally, we further study the performance of existing state-of-the-art robust classifiers on various synthetically generated image distributions.
