# An Empirical Evaluation of Intrinsic Robustness on Real Distributions

The goal of this project:
* Theoretically, derive a intrinsic robustness bound for a large collection of imperfect classifiers using Lipschitz parameter

* Empirically, evaluate the intrinsic robustness bound for benchmark image distributions

* Additionally, we further study the performance of existing state-of-the-art robsut classifiers on various synthetical generated image distributions
